# Welcome to Feed Eat Treat Repeat!

Here's a nutritional food diary that combines meal logging and nutritional analysis. With parents and health-conscious individuals in mind, it serves as a tool to plan meals and as a handy checklist while grocery shopping.

When determining the food item, the API will fetch the closest food item that matches the food name. For example, trying to fetch the nutrition information of "Roti Prata" will result in "Chapati".
